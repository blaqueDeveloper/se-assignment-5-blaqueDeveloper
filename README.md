               <li>In order to debug your code, you need to set up a launch configuration that specifies how your program should be run and debugged. This configuration is typically stored in a file named launch.json within the .vscode folder in your project directory.</li>
               <li>You can create a launch configuration by clicking on the debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + D), then clicking on the gear icon to configure a launch.json file.</li>
               <li>Follow the prompts to select the environment and debugger type (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.) and configure any necessary settings such as program path, command line arguments, environment variables, etc</li>
            </ul>
         <li>Set Breakpoints</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Place breakpoints in your code at locations where you want the debugger to pause execution so you can inspect variables and step through the code.</li>
               <li>To set a breakpoint, click in the gutter next to the line of code where you want to pause execution. A red circle will appear, indicating that a breakpoint has been set.</li>
            </ul>
         <li>Start Debugging</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Once you've configured the launch configuration and set breakpoints, you're ready to start debugging.</li>
               <li>Click on the green play button in the debug toolbar, or press F5 to start debugging.</li>
               <li>The debugger will launch your program according to the launch configuration, and execution will pause at the first breakpoint encountered.</li>
            </ul>
         <li>Debugging Features</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Once debugging has started, you can use various debugging features available in VS Code to inspect variables, evaluate expressions, step through code, and more.</li>
               <li>Some key debugging features include: </li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Step into, over, or out of function calls to navigate through your code one line at a time.</li>
                     <li>View and monitor the values of variables and expressions in real-time as you step through your code.</li>
                     <li>View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls leading up to the current point in execution.</li>
                     <li>Set, enable, disable, and remove breakpoints to control where execution pauses.</li>
                     <li>Set breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met.</li>
                     <li>Interact with your program by executing code in the debug console while debugging.</li>
                  </ul>
            </ul>
      </ol>

         <li>Installing Git</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Before you can use Git with VS Code, you need to have Git installed on your computer. You can download and install Git from the official website: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a></li>
            </ul>
         <li>Open a Project in VS Code</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Open VS Code and navigate to the project folder you want to initialize as a Git repository, or create a new project if needed.</li>
            </ul>
         <li>Initialize a Git Repository</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + P (Mac).</li>
               <li>Type "Git: Initialize Repository" and select it from the list. This command initializes a new Git repository in the current project folder.</li>
            </ul>
         <li>Stage and Commit Changes</li>
            <ul>
               <li>Make changes to your files within the project.</li>
               <li>Open the Source Control view by clicking on the source control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + G).</li>
               <li>You will see a list of changed files. Click on the "+" icon next to a file to stage it for commit.</li>
               <li>Enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.</li>
